Seiji Emery is a 3rd year / transfer student. He has a lot of experience with most major programming languages (c, python, c++, js / typescript, haskell, etc...), and an apparent dislike for using them to do anything useful.

He ran a CMPS 115 project over the summer (and completely burned out b/c the project literally had 3-4 weeks of development time), has done an internship at a company you've never heard of, and wrote a crappy, half finished game engine from scratch in D. For fun. 

He also hates java and thinks UCSC needs to switch its entire CS curriculum over to python, c, and haskell to match berkeley / mit (well, more or less). This is all justified b/c java is a terrible language and he can give you 20 reasons why. (Also, his teammates were terrible at writing good react components and he thinks this was the root cause. Just learn haskell and it'll all make sense!)

He also missed the programming meeting which is why this is being submitted so late.
